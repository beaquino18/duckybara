## Inspiration

**Living your life out to the fullest is crucial because we only live for so long.** That 3 hours of scrolling may not seem like a lot of time, but if you keep at it, you’ll be using YEARS of your life on that damn phone. You could have been doing something memorable, adventurous, and build connections with people. So get out there and just have some fun! At some point, you’ll be tired and old and not able to do the things you were able to do when you were young. But at least you can look back at the happy memories that you made and say you’ve lived a really happy life. 

“What Now..?” is a question we often ask ourselves. Jennifer and Olivia have lived around the Vancouver area for almost their/our whole lives. And the both of us feel as if we’ve already tried most of the interesting activities there is to try. Even Yani who is an international student and has only lived here since 2023, feels as if she’s exhausted the activities that there are to do around here. But after digging into sites like Eventbrite for our hackathon, we all realized how many different activities there are to do of several different categories. Finding an event suitable for you can be hard. That’s why we made “What Now..?”! Just input some info about yourself and find events near you catered to your interests! Let “What Now..?” do all the searching for you  while you go have fun and meet new people! Connecting and having a blast with other people has never been easier!

## How we built it
| Design | Development |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Figma | Html, CSS, Javascript |
| Procreate | Python, Flask |
| Filmora | Render |

## Challenges we ran into
- spending way too much time brainstorming for a leap motion project that we ended up scrapping later. 
- spending a lot of time on figuring out documentation for another technology before fully starting on the current project
- time management for some of the website's special functionality 
- lost progress for the film project in Filmora so we had to recreate it 
- one of the developers had a hardware problem for the laptop 
- getting a custom domain for **__whatnow-duckybara.tech__** was having issues so we used another site, render to host the demo

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- creating a functional website in the limited time provided
- reinforcing our design and development skills 
- taking rejuvenating breaks during the hackathon 

## What we learned
- social life for young adults is **challenging** especially with emerging technologies and social media
- learned how to use Flask, Figma, Git and generative AI in a seamless developer and designer workflow
- planning and design is important when creating technology solutions

## What's next for WhatNow
1. Integrate Socials on the app
2. Incorporate a database for 
   - User authentication
   - Proper saving and data integrity of user entered information
3. Integrate API of site events
(ex. Eventbrite, Devpost, community websites, social media postings)
